Theorems:
1. Boltzmann Distribution for Particle Interactions
   - Describes the particle interactions of dark matter which follows a probability distribution governed by the Boltzmann equation f(v) ∝ exp (-(mv^2)/(2kbT))
   - In short, cryogenics slow the particles velocity (reducing kT) resulting in lower number of high velocity particles and increasing the number of low velocity particles. This allows for better detection, lower mass is
     also benificial.
   Where:
        f(v) = velocity distribution of particles
        m = mass of the particle
        v = velocity of the particle
        kb = Boltzmann constant
        T = temperature
        kbT = thermal energy per particle
        
2. Stefan-Boltzmann Law for Cryogenic Cooling
   - Describes how a cryogenic system loses heat through radiation by the equation P = εσAT^4
   Where:
        P = power radiated (amount of heat loss)
        ε = emissivity (how much a surface emits heat)
        σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant
        A = surface area
        T = temperature
   - The key idea for this theorem is that heat loss increases with temperature T^4
   - In order to keep the cryogenic system cold, we reduce emissivity using reflective coatings and MLI insulation, minimizing radiative heat loss. This process lets us achieve desired cryogenic temperatures!
   - MLI stands for Multilayer Insulation which consists of many thin reflective layers like mylar or kapton seperated by insulating spacers. Reduces radiative heat by reflecting infared radiation between layers,
     preventing heat from reaching the cryogenic system.
   - Reflective coatings are just highly reflective metallic coatings like aluminum or gold applied to surfaces. They reduce emissivity meaning heat is radiated away.
